### FAQ

**Which rendering engine does Via use?**

Via uses the built-in WebView renderer included on the Android platform. On Android 5.0+ devices, the WebView implementation is usually `Android System WebView (com.google.android.webview)`, you can update it in the Play Store for a better browsing experience. If you want to know the current WebView implementation and version of your device, you can click "Settings - About" in Via and tap on the Via logo to get the debugging information which contains the WebView information.

**How to disable JavaScript or set a special user agent for a website?**

Open the site, click the magnifying glass or shield icon on the left side of the address bar, and then you can configure it separately.

Or open "Settings-General-Site Configuration" to add configuration manually.

**I don’t want to block ads on a certain site.**

Please refer to the previous question, you can turn off ad blocking for the site in the site configuration.

**Why can't Via save the password?**

Unfortunately, Google removed this particular feature from WebView. You can try using the autofill app(Bitwarden, KeePass, etc.) if the Android version of your device is higher than or equal to 8.0.

**Why can't Via scan the QR code?**

~~There are too many applications that can scan QR codes, and I don’t want to add such a repetitive function. You can scan the QR code with your phone's camera app.~~

Starting from version 4.3.4, Via has added a built-in QR code scanner.
